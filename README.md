<h3> Descriptions </h3>
<p>
    I am developing a Stripe Web App using React.js for the frontend, integrating the useContext hook for state management, and leveraging REST API for smooth communication between components. For secure and efficient payment processing, I am incorporating the Stripe API and payment gateway.

    On the backend, I am utilizing Node.js to handle server-side operations, with MongoDB as the database for seamless data storage. To ensure robust user authentication and authorization, I am implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and integrating bcrypt for password hashing.
